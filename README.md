# Tokopedia Bug Bounty Rules
Keep user informations safe and secure are our top priority and a core company value at Tokopedia. we are pleased with contribution from external security researchers and look forward to awarding them for their invaluable contribution to the security of all Tokopedia users.
## Responsible Disclosure Policy
If you comply with the policies below when reporting a security issue to Tokopedia, we will not initiate a lawsuit or law enforcement investigation against you in response to your report. We ask that:
- You give us reasonable time to investigate and mitigate an issue that you report before making any information about the report public or sharing such information with others.
- You do not interact with an individual account (which includes modifying or accessing data from the account) if the account owner has not consented to such actions.
- You make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations and disruptions to others, including (but not limited to) unauthorised access to or destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our services.
- You do not exploit a security issue that you discover for any reason. (This includes demonstrating additional risk, such as attempted compromise of sensitive company data or probing for additional issues.)
- You do not intentionally violate any other applicable laws or regulations, including (but not limited to) laws and regulations prohibiting the unauthorised access to data.
- For the purposes of this policy, you are not authorised to access user data or company data, including (but not limited to) personally identifiable information and data relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.
- If you want to publish the vulnerability you reporting, please give us reasonable time to fix it and you can disclose it to the public after you receive approval from Tokopedia team and at least 3 months after the vulnerability is fixed.
## Bug bounty program terms
We recognise and reward security researchers who help us to keep people safe by reporting vulnerabilities in our services. Monetary bounties for such reports are entirely at Tokopedia's discretion, based on risk, impact and other factors. To potentially qualify for a bounty, you first need to meet the following requirements:
- Adhere to our responsible disclosure policy (see above).
- Report a security bug: identify a vulnerability in our services or infrastructure which creates a security or privacy risk. (Note that Tokopedia ultimately determines the risk of an issue, and that many software bugs are not security issues.)
- Your report must describe a problem involving one of the products or services listed below (See "Bug Bounty Program").
- We specifically exclude certain types of potential security issues; these are listed below (See "Bug Bounty Program").
- Submit your report via our "Report a security vulnerability" form (one issue per report) and respond to the report with any updates. Please do not contact employees directly or through other channels about a report.
- If you inadvertently cause a privacy violation or disruption (such as accessing account data, service configurations or other confidential information) while investigating an issue, you must disclose this in your report.
- Use test accounts when investigating issues. If you cannot reproduce an issue with a test account, you can use a real account (except for automated testing). Do not interact with other accounts without consent.
In turn, we will follow these guidelines when evaluating reports under our bug bounty programme:
- We investigate and respond to all valid reports. Due to the volume of reports that we receive, however, we prioritise evaluations based on risk and other factors, and it may take some time before you receive a reply.
- We determine bounty amounts based on a variety of factors, including (but not limited to) impact, ease of exploitation and quality of the report. 
- We aim to pay similar amounts for similar issues, but bounty amounts and qualifying issues may change over time. Past rewards do not necessarily guarantee similar results in the future.
- In the event of duplicate reports, we award a bounty to the first person to submit an issue. (Tokopedia determines duplicates and may not share details on the other reports.) A given bounty is only paid to one individual.
- We reserve the right to publish reports (and accompanying updates).

## Frequently asked questions
**Q: What if I found a vulnerability, but I don't know how to exploit it?**

A: We expect that vulnerability reports sent to us have a valid attack scenario to qualify for a reward, and we consider it as a critical step when doing vulnerability research. Reward amounts are decided based on the maximum impact of the vulnerability, and the panel is willing to reconsider a reward amount, based on new information (such as a chain of bugs, or a revised attack scenario).

**Q: Who determines whether my report is eligible for a reward?**

A: The reward panel consists of the members of the Tokopedia Security Team.

**Q: When will reward be paid?**

A: You will be paid after the vulnerabilty has been fixed by our engineer. So give us reasonable time to fix it.

**Q: What happens if I disclose the bug publicly before you had a chance to fix it?**

A: Please read our **Responsible Disclosure Policy**. In essence, our pledge to you is to respond promptly and fix bugs in a sensible timeframe - and in exchange, we ask for a reasonable advance notice. Reports that go against this principle will usually not qualify, and we cancel the reward. And if it contains sensitive information, it doesn't close the possibility to litigate by applicable laws.
